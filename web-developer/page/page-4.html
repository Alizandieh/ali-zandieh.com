			<h3>Bodybuilding & fitness</h3>
			<p>
				A huge passion of Ali’s is attending the gym. In 2004 he began visiting the gym on an occasional basis but between 2006 and 2009 he began attending more regularly. He upped the number of workouts to 5 or 6 days per week, increased his effort and as a result witnessed an impressive improvement in his body transmission.<br/> <br/>
				Due to restrictions on his time, he is no longer able to maintain this intensity but continues to train at least 2-3 days a week to keep fit.  
			</p>

			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>
				Who can live without music? It is a huge part of our life. Whether it is be happy times, sad times, when you’re angry or in different situations, you need to listen to the appropriate music. Ali enjoys listening to all kinds of music but his favourite, which gives him an incredible energy, is Rock and Heavy Metal. In particular, Ali’s favourite band is PanterA and he continues to be one of their biggest fans, even after PanterA was disbanded in 2002.

			<h3>Playing guitar</h3>
			<p>
				In addition to listening to music, during his spare time, Ali enjoys playing some of the songs he likes listening to and although not professionally, Ali is able to play both the electric and acoustic guitar.
